<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this e-commerece product landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- [x] Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- [x] Add items to the cart
- [x] View the cart and remove items from it

<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    This was a great project to practice my Angular skills that I've been learning. Although it isn't perfect and doesn't use all of the features.
    I am happy that I was able to create and use "Subjects" from RXJS.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    There are a few features missing (light box) and accessibility issues, these will defiently need a revisit in the future.
